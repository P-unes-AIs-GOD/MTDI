Device type detection intelligence (supervised machine learning)

Hi
this code work using a Decision tree (1.1 release) algorithm that is a supervised learning algorithm.
This machine learning with 62 Data line in the XLXS file. you must enter Data as I formatted them in it.
at last, when u entered the data u can understand what kind of Device is urs.
